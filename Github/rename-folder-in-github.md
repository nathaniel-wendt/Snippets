# Renaming a Folder in Github using the Web Interface

1. Select a file within the folder you want to rename and then Select `Edit this file`
2. In the `folder/folder/file-name.md` box at the top, add `../` before the filename
3. Notice the file moves up one folder level and removes the previous folder name
4. Type `new-folder-name` followed by `/`

> Note: You can traverse multiple levels to rename a nested folder `../../` but pay close attention
> because onces it's erased you may have a difficult time remembering the original folder structure.
