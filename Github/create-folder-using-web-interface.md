# Create a new folder in Github using the Web Interface

1. On your Project's main page: Select `Add File` > `Create new file`
2. In the 'Name your file...' box at the top, enter: *folder name*
3. Press the `/` key after the folder name creates the folder
4. Notice your folder name will now appear to the left of the input box
5. Continue by typing *name-of-file.md*
6. Once finished, select `Commit new file` button at the bottom of the page

> Note: You cannot create an empty folder, you must create the folder along with
> at least one file (because Git doesn't track empty folders).
