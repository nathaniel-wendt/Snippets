# How to run a Shell or `.sh` script on MacOS

## Creating a Shell Script
Shell scripts can be created using a text editor (TextEdit) or an IDE (VSCode) - It's as simple as writing your code and saving the file with an `.sh` file extension.

## Running the Script
1. Open the Terminal and `cd` into the folder that your script is in.
> If it's the first time running the script, you'll need to make it executable with the command: `chmod +x test_script.sh`
2. After granting the script permissions to run, use the command `sh test_script.sh` to run it.
