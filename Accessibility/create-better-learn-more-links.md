# What's the problem with 'Learn More' links?
If not implemented properly, 'Learn More' links are vague which creates uncertainty because users won't know what to expect when they click on the link. Will it take them to a new page?
An external site? an App Store? This cognitive strain has a negative impact on the user experience and can be a serious problem for accessibility.

Consider how users of assistive technology navigate websites.  Most screen-reader users will hear a list of links read to them, with no visual context to help them 
make sense of generic 'Learn More' or 'Read More' links - what happens when those links are clicked is anyone's guess. This is the problem we aim to solve.

## What are the benefits of having more descriptive 'Learn More' links?
* Users will know what to expect making the links more accessible and user friendly.
* Users will feel more confident as they navigate the site.
* Improved Keywords will help search-engine optimization.
* Meaningful links will help users who are scanning the page.

## How can 'Learn More' links be improved?
There are three main ways to improve 'Learn More' links:

### Option 1: Use keywords that describe the link's destination.
The most common and, typically, the best approach.  To do this you have to look at the destination page and have a good sense of what it's about. 
Then, [front-load the link text](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning/) by putting the most relevant keywords at the beginning.
For example, instead of "Learn How Professional Chefs Cook Squash", try "Cook Squash Like The Pros".  Front-loading text makes it must faster for users to scan the page
and decide what to do next.

### Option 2. Retain the _Learn More_ format and add descriptive keywords.
It is acceptable to retain 'Learn More', if you expand upon it using relevant information (e.g. _Learn more about our services_). The downsides to this approach are
having space constraints for the longer label (not good for buttons) and reduced scannability because the relevent keywords appear at the end instead of the beginning of the phrase.
To offset this you can try only linking the descriptive phrase, e.g. "Learn more: <ins>about our services</ins>".

### Option 3. Convert the preceding-paragraph heading into the only link.
If the heading of the preceding paragraph is obviously styled to look like a link and the copy clearly desribes what the link points to, then a _Learn More_ link is probably redundant.
